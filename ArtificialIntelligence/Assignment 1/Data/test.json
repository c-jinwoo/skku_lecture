Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance.\"  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n                                April 15, 1993 \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment.

The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\n\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; \u00a32.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles.

Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.\n\nCurrencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. \"It came at the worst possible time,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. \"The impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in Thailand.\" Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding. Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.\n\nShares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value.\n\nHowever, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France's Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. \"It's still too early for concrete damage figures,\" Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. \"That also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically.\"\n\nThe unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. The Dow Jones index had risen 20.54 points, or 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales. In Asian markets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. The country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%. About 5% of Singapore's annual gross domestic product (GDP) comes from tourism. Malaysia's budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%.\n\nTravel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. Concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.\n", "label": "business", "id": 822}, {"paragraph": "Khodorkovsky ally denies charges\n\nA close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are \"false\".\n\nPlaton Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm.

Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. \"To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,\" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.\n\nMr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the \"running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction\". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (\u00a313bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill.

The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption.

G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\n\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across America's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.\n\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.\n\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.\n", "label": "business", "id": 825}, {"paragraph": "Banker loses sexism claim\n\nA former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her \u00a37.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank.\n\nAn employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about \u00a355,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.\n\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.\n\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very disappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill's procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish culture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.\"\n\nBased in London's financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill's global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill's most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.\n", "label": "business", "id": 826}, {"paragraph": "Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden\n\nGeneral Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\n\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\n\nGM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\n\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.\n\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\n\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (\u00a3104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\n\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.\n", "label": "business", "id": 827}, {"paragraph": "McDonald's boss Bell dies aged 44\n\nCharlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald's, has died of cancer aged 44.\n\nMr Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in May last year, a month after taking over the top job. He resigned in November to fight the illness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia's youngest store manager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive McDonald's sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. \"As we mourn his passing, I ask you to keep Charlie's family in your hearts and prayers,\" chief executive James Skinner said in a statement. \"And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest.\" \"No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald's.\"\n\nAfter running the company's Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald's second most important market. He became chief operating officer and president in 2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald's around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the company get \"fat, dumb and happy,\" and, according to Reuters, once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald's \"I'm lovin' it\" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.

Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.\n\nAt the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their \"green\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year.\n\nHonda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV.\n\nOthers remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. \"We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. \"The average consumers aren't willing to pay that premium for a car they won't drive more than six years,\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power.\n", "label": "business", "id": 829}, {"paragraph": "Economy 'strong' in election year\n\nUK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\n\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"\n", "label": "business", "id": 830}, {"paragraph": "China continues breakneck growth\n\nChina's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.\n\nThe news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\n\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\n\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\n\nChina's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China's currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\n", "label": "business", "id": 831}, {"paragraph": "Dutch bank to lay off 2,850 staff\n\nABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to cut 2,850 jobs as a result of falling profits.\n\nThe cuts - amounting to 3% of the bank's workforce - will result in a one-off charge of 790m euros ($1.1bn). About 1,100 jobs will go in investment banking while 1,200 and 550 will go in IT and human resources respectively. ABN Amro is the third large European bank to announce cutbacks in the past month following Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse Group.\n\nIts profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the United States - the bank's largest single market - following recent interest rate rises. ABN Amro's operations in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will be hardest hit. Jobs will also be lost in the US - which accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across its operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.\n\nThe restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing administrative costs and increasing focus on client service. The bank said it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues. ABN Amro currently has more than 100,000 staff. \"To get any profit growth in the coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes total sense,\" Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told Bloomberg.

That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\n\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.\n", "label": "business", "id": 833}, {"paragraph": "Weak end-of-year sales hit Next\n\nNext has said its annual profit will be \u00a35m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing.\n\n\"Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations,\" the company said. The High Street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between \u00a3415m and \u00a3425m ($779m-798m). Next's shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement.\n\nNext chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were \"below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be\", but said sales should still top analyst expectations.\n\nAmong areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear ranges were \"a little bit too similar to the previous year\". Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were \"more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn't there for the stock\". Next's like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected by new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%.\n\nOverall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period. \"In terms of all the worries about their trading pre-Christmas, it's a result,\" said Nick Bubb, an analyst at Evolution Securities. \"Profits of around \u00a3420m would be well within the comfort zone.\" However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told Reuters the seasonal sales performance was \"not what people had hoped for\". \"Christmas has been tough for the whole sector, and this is one of the best retailers,\" he said.

There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\n", "label": "business", "id": 835}, {"paragraph": "Christmas shoppers flock to tills\n\nShops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before Christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers.\n\nA spokesman for Manchester's Trafford Centre said it was \"the biggest Christmas to date\" with sales up 5%. And the Regent Street Association said shops in central London were also expecting the \"best Christmas ever\". That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.\n\nThe Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had arrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT. \"We predict that the next week will continue the same trend,\" she added.\n\nIt was a similar story at Bluewater in Kent. Spokesman Alan Jones said he expected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of Saturday and a further 100,000 on Sunday. \"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year,\" he said. \"We're very busy, it's really strong and people will be shopping right up until Christmas. \"Over the Christmas period we're expecting people to spend in excess of \u00a3200m at the centre.\"\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David's Shopping Centre in Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. At the St Enoch's Shopping Centre in Glasgow, more than 140,000 shoppers - an all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by its closing time of 1900 GMT. Senior business manager Jon Walton said: \"It has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed. \"Every week footfall has been showing strong growth and at the weekends it has been going mad.\" Regent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: \"The stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the week.\"\n\nShe said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the growing popularity of internet sales. \"I do think this has had a lot to do with reports of lower sales figures,\" she said. \"Internet shopping has gone up enormously and not all stores have websites.\"\n", "label": "business", "id": 836}, {"paragraph": "Disaster claims 'less than $10bn'\n\nInsurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern Asia.\n\nMunich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (\u00a35.17bn). Swiss Re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in double-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (\u00a370m; $136m).\n\nAt least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit. The region's resorts and Western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants.\n\nLloyds of London told the Financial Times it expected its exposure to be limited to \"holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and marine risks\". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. The company has paid out about 300 million euros (\u00a3281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US.\n\nBut insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through.\n\n\"So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,\" said Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department. \"You need very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike the hurricanes, you can't just run a model.\" He anticipated that his own company's total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, which the company put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. However, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a \"significant\" impact on its business. Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.\n\nThe impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.\n\nMost US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the \"billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia,\" said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb. \"US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,\" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co.\n\nMany of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (\u00a32.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch.\n\nMitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. But the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. \"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,\" said Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.\"\n\nThe figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than \u00a3600 from \u00a3190,329 in November to \u00a3189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added.

This was followed the same day by Mark Paulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his Paulsmeier Group was interested in M&S. A sudden spike in M&S's share price followed. However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid.

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\n\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall.

Here are a few of the most useful answers from the comment thread.\n\n\u201cDon't underestimate its importance. The best ideas, the most beautiful imagery, the most harmonious colour combinations will be blighted by inferior typography. So work at it, study it.\n\n\u201cLook at all those great names in graphic design history; Tschichold, Schleger, Rand, Fletcher, Aicher, Muller-Brockmann; and look at their beautiful type. They understood the need to understand it.\u201d\n\u2014 Richard Weston of Ace Jet 170\n\n\u201cPicking up copy of Type and Typography can be immensely helpful. It\u2019s got a particularly useful section about the styling of details within text.\u201d\n\u2014 Alistair Hall of We Made This\n\n\u201cAs always, make sure you play with silly ideas on paper too, they get the creative juice flowing.\u201d\n\u2014 Fernando Lins\n\nI agree. Using a pen and paper has been a huge help with my projects.\n\n\u201cLook at historical design masters, don't dismiss them because they are old or because you have seen it all before. Richard Hollis' book on Swiss Graphic Design is great because it covers so many masters and shows you so many examples of work.\n\n\u201cI second the suggestion of getting a boring book about rules. The details are what I look at. If you haven't got them down then they will stand out, but that's just me: a dusty old fogey. If I see an en dash used properly I appreciate it. Robert Bringhurt's book, The Elements of Typographic Style, is great for this.\u201d\n\u2014 Jaypeg\n\nThere's a quote from a Russian graphic designer that struck a chord, shown in a comment by Alicia.\n\n\u201cThe black space can never be beautiful until the white space is beautiful.\u201d\n\nOther recommended typography books are Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How Type Works, by Erik Spiekermann, and Thinking with Type, by Ellen Lupton.

Basically, graphic designers do the job of communication to others by means of graphic (visual) elements such as images of different styles and complexity, types and fonts, pictograms, shapes and sizes, colors and shades, lines and curves, etc. Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception transfer the message, so he makes them functional. Therefore, we could say that graphic designers are artists applying their talents mostly not in pure art but communicating and purposeful art.\n\nModern graphic design broadly covers all spheres of human life which deal with visual communication, from books and posters to sophisticated mobile applications or 3D animation. Let\u2019s look into directions in which graphic designers can express their creativity for the sake of solving problems and satisfying needs.\nGraphic design directions\nNowadays, graphic design is an incredibly broad sphere for the application of artistic talents. In particular, it includes:\n\neditorial design\nillustration\nidentity (logo and branding) design\nicons and pictograms\ntypography\ninterface graphics and elements\nprint advertisements\nbig print items such as posters and billboards\nsigns\npackaging etc.\nThus, it\u2019s easily seen that modern designers in this sphere have multiple options to apply their talents.

Do you need to save a photo with a plain background for your e-commerce store or new blog? There are several reasons why you may want to make an image background transparent.\n\nBut just in case you are wondering how to make the background of a picture transparent, all hope is not lost yet. Below we will describe three methods using various photo editing software like Photoshop, PhotoWorks and Paint that you can use to get rid of an unwanted background for a picture for your website. \n\nMethod 1. Using Photoshop\nPhotoshop is one of the leading photo editing software you can use to create an image with transparent background. It\u2019s no surprise that it is on this list, a vast number of photo editors use it across the globe.\n\nHere are a few steps you need to follow to use Photoshop to remove the background of an image.\n\nStep 1. Choose Quick selection from the list of tools on the toolbar.\n\nStep 2. Choose the part of the image you want to retain. Photoshop will automatically help you isolate it from the background.\n\nStep 3. If the automatic selection isn\u2019t as accurate as you like, you can use the Subtract from selection option to retouch the edges.\n\nStep 4. Now you can inverse the selection by right-clicking and choosing Select inverse. The background image of the picture should now be transparent.", "label": "graphics", "id": 854}, {"paragraph": "Straighten and Crop\nAfter you insert your image into an image editing software the first thing you should do is to ensure your image is straight enough. Framing is an important aspect of making images look from good to great. To hit the right spot with image framing you should have to have the knowledge about photography and framing. I can give you what I know but let\u2019s keep that for another day.\nSo the first thing is to straighten your image and this can be done by cropping your image. Use the cropping tool of your image editing software and use a grid view while you crop. Why grid view is important? Well, the whole photography or cinematography is standing upon one rule. That is the \u201cRule of Thirds\u201d. To be able to put your image one the rule of thirds you have to use the grid view. So, use grid view and crop tool, then crop your image, straighten it, put it in the rule of thirds.\n\nRemove Dust Particles\nThe next must-do thing in your image editing is fixing the image. The process that we use to remove dust, spots, blemishes, and wrinkles from a photo is the photo retouching service. In this image editing technique, we use the Healing Brush Tool, Patch Tool, Red Eye, Clone Tool, Eraser Tool, Blur Tool, Dodge, and Burn Tools to fix the imperfection of the image.\n\nDuring the photoshoot, a photographer tries as hard as possible to get the perfect click but the raw image from the camera may contain dust particles, or maybe something came into the background. These are unavoidable and uncontrollable circumstances. So what should we do if we face something like this? The answer is image post-processing in photoshop.\n\nIf you get minor spots, scratches, or blemishes image retouching technique can save you. On the other hand, if you unwanted subject appearing in your frame then the background removal process will help you. In background removal service all you need to do is use the clipping path technique to select the object you want to remove and then hit the delete button.\nAdjust the Highlights and Shadows\nHighlights and shadows are an important aspect of an image and if you messed up here, your image will look awful. Generally, the photographer tries hard to keep the highlights and shadows close to perfect during the shoot. So, try to achieve the maximum balance of highlights and shadow in the raw image and then make it perfect in post-processing.", "label": "graphics", "id": 855}, {"paragraph": "Note the Followup-To: header ...\nsteelem@rintintin.Colorado.EDU (STEELE MARK A) writes:\n>Is there a collection of forms routines that can be used with curses?\n>If so where is it located?\nOn my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for\nuse with the curses library.

This small feature is great for designers that are experimenting with new techniques and want to get or give feedback.\n\nFor editing on a tablet, this is probably one of the best, and most professional options available.\nWhile tweaking images is fun, Procreate is really designed for illustrators. The brush library has more than 130 brushes that create almost any art technique you can images. There\u2019s also a dual-texture system so you can mix and match brush types.\n\nEvery brush is customizable as well. (You\u2019d be hard-pressed to have this many tools in an actual studio.) And we have a collection of 30+ of the best Procreate brushes to get you started!\n\nWhat sets Procreate apart in terms of illustration is that this is a professional set of tools. You can create a huge canvas to work on and export the drawings in high resolution still or video frames.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how cool the illustration tools are until you start playing with them.

If you want somewhat wider strips, flatten the strips with your hands to a width of 2\".  Bake for about 50 minutes at 300.  Let the strips cool for 5 minutes, and them remove them with a spatula to a cutting surface.  Using a sharp knife and making downward strokes, cut the strips into diagonal bars about 1/2\" wide.

He was treated with injections of vitamin B12 along with advice on how to improve his diet. \nHowever, by age 15, he developed hearing loss and vision problems, but doctors couldn't seem to find the cause \u2014 results from an MRI and eye exam were normal.\n\nOver the next two years, the teen's vision got progressively worse. When the boy was 17, an eye test showed that his vision was 20/200 in both eyes, the threshold for being \"legally blind\" in the United States.\n\nFurther tests showed the teen had developed damage to his optic nerve, the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain. In addition, the teen still had low levels of vitamin B12, along with low levels of copper, selenium and vitamin D.\n\nThese deficiencies prompted doctors to ask the teen about the foods he ate. \"The patient confessed that, since elementary school, he would not eat certain textures of food,\" the authors, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, wrote in the report. He told doctors that the only things he ate were fries, chips \u2014 specifically, Pringles \u2014 white bread, processed ham slices and sausage.\n\nAfter ruling out other possible causes for his vision loss, the teen was diagnosed with nutritional optic neuropathy, or damage to the optic nerve that results from nutritional deficiencies. The condition can be caused by drugs, malabsorption of food, poor diet or alcohol abuse. \"Purely dietary causes are rare in developed countries,\" the authors said.\n\nIt's known that the B vitamins are essential for many cellular reactions, and deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to the buildup of toxic byproducts of metabolism, and eventually to the damage of nerve cells, according to the University of Iowa.\n\nVision loss from nutritional optic neuropathy is potentially reversible if caught early. However, by the time the teen was diagnosed, his vision loss was permanent. What's more, wearing glasses would not help the teen's vision, because damage to the optic nerve cannot be corrected with lenses, said study lead author Dr. Denize Atan, a consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School and Bristol Eye Hospital. \n\nThe teen was prescribed nutritional supplements, which prevented his vision loss from getting any worse.\n\nThe teen was also referred to mental health services for an eating disorder. The researchers note that the teen's diet was more than just \"picky eating\" because it was very restrictive and caused multiple nutritional deficiencies. \n\nA relatively new diagnosis known as \"avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder\" (previously known as \"selective eating disorder\") involves a lack of interest in food or avoidance of foods with certain textures, colors, etc., without concern to body weight or shape. The condition usually starts in childhood, and patients often have a normal body mass index (BMI), as was the case for this patient, the authors said.", "label": "food", "id": 866}, {"paragraph": "3 1/4          cups  all-purpose flour\n   2 1/2     teaspoons  baking powder\n     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened\n       1           cup  sugar\n       3                eggs\n       2     teaspoons  lemon peel -- finely shredded\n     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract\n       1         pinch  saffron -- if desired\n     1/2           cup  almonds -- finely chopped,toast\n       1                egg white\n\nCombine flour and baking powder.

Regarding food allergies, when some people eat a certain type of food \u2014 such as nuts, shellfish, wheat or dairy \u2014 it broadcasts an alarm signal to their immune system, provoking reactions that can vary widely between individuals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nSymptoms of food allergies can include hives, itching and swelling in the nose and throat, and stomach pain or nausea. In extreme cases, food allergies may lead to anaphylaxis \u2014 a state of shock accompanied by low blood pressure and constricted airways \u2014 which can be fatal if untreated, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nShellfish is the most common food allergen in the U.S., affecting approximately 7 million adults, according to the study. Milk allergies affect nearly 5 million people, followed closely by peanut allergies, which affect about 5 million people. Other widespread allergens include tree nuts, fish, eggs, wheat, soy and sesame, the scientists reported.\n\nAllergies can be inherited or acquired, sometimes unexpectedly \u2014 bites from a type of tick have been linked to the onset of an allergy to meat, and a woman who recently received a lung transplant also acquired her organ donor's peanut allergy.\n\nIn fact, developing food allergies in adulthood happens more frequently than expected, the scientists reported. They learned from the surveys that about 48 percent of the subjects who had food allergies first experienced at least one of them as an adult.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that adult-onset food allergies were so common,\" Gupta said.\n\nIf a person suspects that they have a food allergy, it is critical that they visit a doctor for testing and diagnosis before attempting to correct the problem by eliminating foods from their diet, Gupta said in the statement.\n\n\"If food allergy is confirmed, understanding the management is also critical, including recognizing symptoms of anaphylaxis and how and when to use epinephrine,\" he added.", "label": "food", "id": 870}, {"paragraph": " 2   tablespoons  margarine\n       1         stalk  celery -- chopped\n       1        cloves  garlic -- minced\n     1/2           cup  med onion -- chopped\n       2          cups  vegetable stock\n      16        ounces  frozen peas\n       1          dash  white pepper\n     1/2           cup  low-fat milk\n       1          dash  nutmeg\n\nGARNISH: Herbed garlic Croutons, 1/4 c chopped fresh parsley and 2 T lemon peel, or grated Parmesan cheese, optional.

Twinkies, after all, are not eaten for health, but for the joy of chewing yellow sponge cake injected with non-perishable cream. But it might surprise you to know that there's never been any real data to back this up.\n\nMost researchers and nutritionists theorized that ultra-processed food makes you overeat, on top of being high in calories, sugar, and fat while being low in fiber. To test that hypothesis, researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recruited 20 volunteers, evenly split by gender, and kept them in a special wing of the NIH Clinical Center for 28 days straight. Nutrition studies are often plagued by having too many variables you can\u2019t control for. People who eat more processed foods also tend to have other factors that might influence their health, like having less money to pay for healthcare or less time to spend exercising. Just observing the general traits of folks consuming junk food won\u2019t get you to any definitive conclusions\u2014you can only ever get associations.\n\nSo instead of just observing what people ate, the NIH researchers prescribed and controlled every single meal, plus the amount of daily exercise the participants got. For the first two weeks, half of the group ate a diet rich in veggies, whole grains, and other unprocessed food, while the other half ate ultra-processed stuff. Every meal contained twice as many calories as the person would actually need to maintain their body weight, and everyone was told to eat as much or as little as they wanted. Then the groups swapped menus for the last two weeks of the study, which was published this week in the journal Cell Metabolism.\n\nThe most important part of this study, though, is that the meals were matched on their macros. Whether you were on the processed or unprocessed week, each meal had roughly the same number of carbs, fat, protein, fiber, sugar, and total calories. The researchers couldn\u2019t match more specific categories, like added sugar or saturated fat, simply because it\u2019s hard to find chips and fruit juice that are as low in those unhealthy nutrients as whole foods are.\n\n", "label": "food", "id": 873}, {"paragraph": "3 1/2          cups  flour\n       1           cup  sugar\n     1/2           cup  butter -- softened\n       2     teaspoons  baking powder\n     1/2      teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated\n     1/2      teaspoon  salt\n       2                eggs\n                        -----vanilla cream-----\n     2/3           cup  sugar\n       3    tablespoon  cornstarch\n     1/4      teaspoon  salt\n       3                egg yolks\n       2           cup  milk\n       1    tablespoon  butter\n       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract\n       1      teaspoon  almond extract -- optional\n\nBlend everything in large bowl and mix.

Most people know someone who\u2019s lactose intolerant. These individuals lack the enzyme lactase (to varying degrees) that allows them to break down lactose, the sugar in milk. If they consume a large amount of lactose-containing dairy, the undigested lactose builds up in the gut causing uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and diarrhea until the stuff passes through the digestive tract. Though uncomfortable, that gastrointestinal distress is never life-threatening. As such, they can absolutely drink a milkshake (though they will likely pay for it later).\n\nOn the other hand, you probably don't know someone with a milk allergy because that's much less common. But if you do, you know they can't drink milkshakes. That's because they have a true allergy, which means the root of the problem is not in their digestive systems, but rather in their immune systems. Allergists call these responses \"IgE-mediated\" because, well, they're mediated by a protein called Immunoglobulin E. IgE is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites. People with allergies accidentally produce IgE molecules that identify harmless proteins like those in peanuts, shellfish, or milk as being dangerous. That means upon ingestion, IgE are like the alarm that kicks up a massive immune response, recruiting histamines and other immune cells that kill the invader. It's this overreaction that causes your throat to close or your blood pressure to drop precipitously, or any of the other allergic symptoms that transcend one bodily organ and extend into the respiratory system or perhaps the skin or cardiovascular system.

The episode featuring the 28-year-old will be screened on 25 January. Farrell's appearance is said to be a result of his friendship with Zach Braff, who stars in the programme. It will be the actor's first appearance on the small screen since he appeared in BBC series Ballykissangel in 1999. The gentle Sunday night drama came to an end in 2001.\n\nHe has since become one of Hollywood's fastest-rising stars, with a string roles in major league films such as Minority Report, Phone Booth and Daredevil.

Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.\n\nSampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton's recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. \"We hold that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton's copyright,\" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion.

Buhecha, who made \u00a326,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\n\nAn operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation's anti-piracy director David Martin said: \"The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it's vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"\n", "label": "entertainment", "id": 887}, {"paragraph": "Tarantino 'to make Friday sequel'\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is in talks to write and direct a new instalment in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe film-maker will reportedly meet executives from New Line Cinema this week to discuss the 12th film in the long-running 'stalk and slash' series.

They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that \u00a3500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for \u00a3340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\n\nOscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards.

There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nFox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson.

All the important people. \"I guess it's just a television show but we always think it's a bit more.' The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show. As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.\n\n\"It's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. But you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting,\" explains Conti. And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. \"We don't know who the winners will be. So when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,\" adds Conti.\n\nThe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers.\n\nThe decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music is relayed from the director's box to the orchestra via Conti's earpiece. \"I don't feel good about it at all. It's not my call though,\" he says. \"When the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. We don't usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. \"The person that's been cut off, who's 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it's death time.\" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. \"Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,\" he says. Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only.\n\n\"It's a moment in the sun,\" he says. \"When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. \"But there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.\"\n\nThe image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. \"There's a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. I can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.\n\n\"I have to communicate with the director. I have a little microphone that's attached to my headset. To open up that microphone, I have a footswitch,\" he explains. Conti's most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. Conti immediately told the show's director: \"I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or I'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes. \"'Oh no Bill don't do anything,\" came the response. \"Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we're playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.\" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. \"No one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time,\" laughs Conti. When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor's Ball with his family. \"I have a drink and relive the show,\" he says. \"I'm not for too much carousing.

The production company is behind films such as My Beautiful Laundrette, Billy Elliot, About A Boy, Shaun of The Dead and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.\n\nSimon Pegg, who stars in and co-wrote Shaun of the Dead, won the 2004 Peter Sellers Award For Comedy. Other winners included Emily Blunt and Nathalie Press who were jointly named ITV London Most Promising Newcomer Award for their performances in Pawel Pawlikowski's rites-of-passage story, My Summer of Love. Pawlikowski won the best screenplay statuette, while Roger Deakins won the Technical Achievement Award for his cinematography on The Village and The Ladykillers. Guests at the ceremony included Dame Judi Dench, Kim Cattrall, Charles Dance, Bill Nighy and Colin Firth. The awards, which were hosted by Jack Dee, are to be screened on ITV London on Tuesday at 2300 GMT.\n", "label": "entertainment", "id": 899}, {"paragraph": "Joy Division story to become film\n\nThe life of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is to be made into a film, it has been announced.\n\nThe Manchester-based production is called Touching From A Distance, after a book by Curtis's widow Deborah which forms the basis for the film. Music mogul Tony Wilson, who headed the record company Joy Division were signed to, will be co-executive producer. The musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the US. Mr Wilson, who has remained friends with Curtis's widow and daughter Natalie, who he says asked for his involvement to make the film \"official\". \"People have different ideas as to why Ian committed suicide, so maybe the film will reflect those different views,\" he told the BBC News website.\n\nPlans for a separate Joy Division film had been announced at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but the project did not get off the ground as it failed to get the backing of Curtis's family. Mr Wilson, who was also involved with Joy Division's sucessor band New Order, as well as the Happy Mondays, said he would \"rather not\" appear in the film. He made a cameo appearance in 24 Hour Party People, in which his leading role was played by Steve Coogan. \"I'm not an actor and I did a lousy job playing my part in 24 Hour Party People,\" said the Factory Records founder, who has been associated with the Manchester music scene since the 1970s. \"Film people have a tendency to mess up when they touch music, but I hope this one works.\n\n\"This is much more than the music - they want to do the real story of Ian,\" he said. The film is to be directed by Dutch-born Anton Corbijn, who has made music movies for Depeche Mode and U2. It will be produced by a US production company, while the widow of Ian Curtis will also be an executive producer.\n", "label": "entertainment", "id": 900}, {"paragraph": "Could someone please send me the basics of the NASP project:\n1.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news.

In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\n    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join.

He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.\n\nMr MacDonald told BBC News: \"The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. \"The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. \"I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally\".\n\nUnder the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. \"My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. \"As far as I'm concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this.\" he added.\n\nThe Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had \"no idea\" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go. \"I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,\" he said. \"They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.\"\n\nHelena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. \"When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,\" she said. \"Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.\"\n", "label": "politics", "id": 921}, {"paragraph": "Straw praises Kashmir moves\n\nThe UK has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of Kashmir.\n\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the \"spirit of cooperation\" in achieving the breakthrough. Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris. The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday. Kashmiri politicians on both sides of the Line of Control which divides the region welcomed the move.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad \"will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades\". \"This will make a real difference to the lives of Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control,\" he said. \"I warmly applaud the efforts of both India and Pakistan to make this happen. \"This spirit of cooperation will, I hope, lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region.\"\n\nOn Thursday Mr Straw was in India visiting Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he tried his hand at making Indian bread or roti. He is due to take part in talks with the Indian government on Friday. A second bus service linking the Pakistani city of Lahore with Amritsar in India was also announced as well as a rail link between Rajasthan state and Pakistan's Sindh province. Both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in Karachi and Mumbai (Bombay). The mountainous region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.\n", "label": "politics", "id": 922}, {"paragraph": "Parties' plans for council tax\n\nAnger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.\n\nPensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was \"fundamentally flawed\" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.\n\nLabour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a \u00a3100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be \"radical reform\". The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005.\n\nThe Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. They say they can save \u00a34bn on \"government waste\", of which \u00a31.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of \u00a3340. It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of \u00a3500. The Tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least \u00a3300m. They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a \"ceiling\" on what the richest pay. The party says it would aim for a \u00a35,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a \u00a37,000 allowance for the over-65s. After that income would be taxed up to \u00a3100,000. The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.\n", "label": "politics", "id": 923}, {"paragraph": "Brown shrugs off economy fears\n\nGordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a \u00a31bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.\n\nIn an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK \"industrial history\" but denied he was \"gloating\". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown \"Sir Wastealot\".\n\nThe shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's \"golden rule\" had \"turned to dross in his hands\" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling \u00a3170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs: \"The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money.\"\n\nVincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.\n\nHe said: \"Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. \"There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.\n\nMr Brown's insistence he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.\n\nIt includes a \u00a3285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history\", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of \u00a350 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra \u00a31bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\n\nMr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are \u00a335bn - \u00a32.5bn less than the \u00a337.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to \u00a331bn by 2005/06 - but that is still \u00a32bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also pledged an extra \u00a3105m for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working.

In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers. That was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.\n\n\"I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,\" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. \"How it interacts with the Commons is a very, very important issue. \"We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes.\" The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker.

Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\n\nMr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\n\nMr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\n\nMr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\n\nVeritas? It's the BNP in an expensive suit!\n\nIt's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. In my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-Islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.\n\nI think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy -Silk opposing Geoff Hoon!!\n\nGood to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe. We benefit enormously from our membership of the EU, we need to be at the heart of Europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.\n\nAll mouth and trousers. A clown. Trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term.\n\nWhatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England. This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.\n\nHopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever!\n\nAt last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. The electorate is disillusioned with British politics. Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.\n\nBoth UKIP and RK-S are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?\n\nMany people believe you Kilroy. You may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.\n\nThe very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating. One can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.\n\nI've always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.\n\nBrilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!\n\nHaving seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.\n\nFantastic news. Pro-Europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections. Robert Kilroy-Silk's ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters') worst enemy.\n\nAs a euro-enthusiast I could not be more delighted by Kilroy-Silk's behaviour. He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.\n\nIf every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long! You've got to hand it to Kilroy-Silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.\n\nWhilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP. I believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the EU and to show our people what belonging to the EU really means. The EU's comments last week about Michael Howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states. The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better\n\nDoes anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name? Is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous?\n\nI think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point. British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. They are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. As a result I feel our democracy is being abused and I want it stopped. If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.\n\nHonestly, who really cares? Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.\n\nAs one of Kilroy-Silk's East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. I feel insulted by having him represent me in the European Parliament.\n\nUKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP's democratic nature.\n\nKilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not. He tried to make it work, but they didn't seem to want to grow up. He was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy. Good luck to the man, I say.\n\nOh please! This is an amusing irrelevance. There is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument. They will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union. Future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.\n\nThe refreshing thing about Robert is that he is open, honest and straight. What other politician can claim this. I have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. I shall be voting for him.\n\nThe electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP. Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list. He has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the European Parliament.\n\nI wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk.

Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear.\n\nThe bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. Ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. Critics fear it could allow \"killing by omission\" through withdrawing treatment, including food and fluids.\n\nTony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. But changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland. \"It is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs. The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. But that only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. Eventually, he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes, prompting claims of a shambles. The deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.\n\nLord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords. He told BBC News: \"We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. \"The motive has got to be to end suffering.\" He denied the concessions were a \"political manoeuvre\" forced by panic about the rebellion. It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a \"sensible solution\", he said. \"I don't think it is something to be embarrassed about. These issues are not easy to deal with,\" he went on. BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Mr Lammy was \"waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast\" after his performance. But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an \"excellent job\".

The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\n\nThe bulk of the \u00a335bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The \u00a312bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the \u00a312bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\n\nMr Howard is expected to say that around \u00a36bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by \u00a31.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of \u00a3153m at the Foreign Office and \u00a3336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.\n\nMr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is \u00a335bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of \u00a335bn worth of savings. \"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests.

On Tuesday Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. The Britons were detained as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". The archbishop added: \"Whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind? \"We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.\n\n\"Now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to Britain and the United States.

However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all.

Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\".

Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but \"needed proper policing\". The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a \"clear choice\" on the issue. The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had \"done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit\" on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.\n\nThe home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to \"ensure we can know everybody who is in the country\". Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, he said \"economic migrants are of great value to this country\", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a \"burden on society\". He said: \"We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.\"\n\nThe home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on Monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. \"The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,\" he said.

A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\n\nThis is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\n\nThank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\n\nIt is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\n\nUKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\n\nIf he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\n\nSo UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\n\nInteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\n\nEvery opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\n\nWell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here\n\nLet's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\n\nVeritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?\n", "label": "politics", "id": 933}, {"paragraph": "Labour plans maternity pay rise\n\nMaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by \u00a31,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\n\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\n\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra \u00a31,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\n\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\n\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said.

Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government. But it partly collapsed over the Conservative leader's own role, prompting the Queen to ask Harold Wilson to form a Labour government. The February 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control. Sir Edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week. Labour emerged with the most seats - but its 301 MPs were 17 short of the number Mr Wilson needed to form a majority.\n\nSir Edward, who had received more votes but had fewer MPs, believed he had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support his government. He said the Liberals could keep out Labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three Cabinet members in a coalition with the Conservatives. According to the documents released at the National Archives, the \"friendly and easy\" first meeting indicated that both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal. Mr Thorpe was in high spirits, having just led his party to a historic jump in support. He also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. But Sir Edward said that was impossible because the Labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact.\n\nHours later Sir Edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as Mr Thorpe's colleagues refused to support him. \"Jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally,\" reads a telephone memo for Mr Heath.\n\n\"They feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister. \"Asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not, I am very close to Ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult.\" The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Mr Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Sir Edward's resignation. Mr Thorpe told Sir Edward: \"I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you. \"Somehow I personally hope that we can work something out.\"\n\nFour hours later, Sir Edward called the Liberal leader back to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal. The minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated. \"The PM said he was bound to tell Mr Thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. Mr Thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister's colleagues.\" Documents show that Sir Edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a Labour-led coalition. But he already knew Mr Wilson would not form a coalition with either the Liberals or the Conservatives because of the opposition of the Labour left. Within hours of his final talks with Mr Thorpe, Sir Edward told the nation he was resigning and the Queen invited Mr Wilson to form a new minority government.\n", "label": "politics", "id": 935}, {"paragraph": "'Best person' for top legal job\n\nThe \"best person for the job\" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.\n\nUnder reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. \"The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,\" said courts minister Christopher Leslie. The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday. Mr Leslie said: \"The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons.\" Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.\n\nIn December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed. Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor. He said: \"What matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. \"It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.\"\n\nShadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an \"exceptional institution,\" providing a \"champion of the independence of the judiciary\". The government had initially proposed to take this institution and \"smash it to pieces,\" Mr Grieve said. Convention should be \"nurtured and celebrated,\" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have \"great difficulty\" in getting the Bill through Parliament. Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was \"largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive\".

Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be \"intolerant of intolerance\". Diversity \"certainly must not mean segregated or separate\", he said. Mr Bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.\n\nBadly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.\n\nMr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a \"common heritage\" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. \"I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society,\" said Mr Bell. The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools. \"Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.\" Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were \"tricky issues\". But he argued that \"we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation\". \"I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,\" said Mr Bell.\n", "label": "politics", "id": 937}, {"paragraph": "Drink remark 'acts as diversion'\n\nThe first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk \"once in a while\" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.\n\nJack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell's comment was \"ill-advised\". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\n\nThe one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\n\nMr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\n\n\"We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\n\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"\n", "label": "politics", "id": 938}, {"paragraph": "Howard taunts Blair over splits\n\nTony Blair's feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime minister's questions.\n\nMr Howard asked: \"How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?\" That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters. But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people's priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour. \"He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to,\" he said. The chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book.\n\nBrown's Britain, by Robert Peston, says there is mutual animosity between the two men. It claims Mr Blair said in November 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. But he went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him, it says.\n\nMr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday. He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit.\n\nThe Tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. He declared: \"He is the deals on meals prime minister. No wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater.\" He continued: \"How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government, how can they clean up our hospitals when they don't clean up their act?\" Mr Blair said he would not respond to \"tittle tattle in books\" and promised to hail Labour's record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order \"from now until polling day\". Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how \"juvenile\" the prime minister and chancellor were.\n\nLabour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday, where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.

The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with \"potentially confrontational\" situations. But the government said the move would help police \"build safe communities\". Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as \"eyes and ears\" for the police.\n\n\"They should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is,\" she said. CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. The powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. Ms Berry said this \"dramatically changes\" their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. She said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.\n\nBut Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers \"just that little bit of edge\". She denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.\n\n\"The powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling,\" she said. The Home Office has produced its own report on CSOs which it describes as \"encouraging\". Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are \"making a real difference\" in the fight against crime. But the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.\n\nShadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.\n\n\"While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone,\" he said. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the research is inconclusive. There are about 3,500 CSOs in England and Wales but the government intends to have 25,000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of \u00a350m.

Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.\n\nRooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when Rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. Rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again Martyn denied the England striker.\n\n- Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson: \"It was a fantastic performance by us.

But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia O'Sullivan's Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn't have been surprised. At the start of the year, an O'Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombard's shattering of Mark Carroll's national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\n\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn't have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the women's 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\n\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee's Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andy's many friends.

The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.\n\nHe was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell's injury claims. \"To go to Athens and finally get the gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,\" said Campbell. \"It was a chance for me to prove that if I'd been fit I would have been challenging for the (individual) medals. \"Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? \"It's just unfortunate that I picked up that injury just before the Olympics.\" Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998.

But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\n", "label": "sport", "id": 944}, {"paragraph": "Athens memories soar above lows\n\nWell, it's goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.\n\nObviously, there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. \n\n \n\nOne of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly's success in the 800m.\n\nWinning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Kelly had been full of \"should I, shouldn't I?\" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. I thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event? It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story. \n\n \n\nThe victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games. I think the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. \n\n \n\nHicham El Guerrouj's Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly's on a global scale.\n\nHe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. As soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and I had finished commentating, I jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. He is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories. Hicham is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my French and his English are not very good. \n\n \n\nWhat happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood. Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. That was her heart and not her head reacting. Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.\n\nThings like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained. And if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. The positive thing to take from Paula's Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. \n\n \n\nPurely as a race, Paula's victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. It was so nip-and-tuck between her and Kenya's Susan Chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real \"bouncebackability\". And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. \n\n \n\nKelly and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team. We should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.\n\nThe only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? And that's where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB. The thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond. \n\n \n\nI tell you what I really enjoyed this year, Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March. In the absence of Paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve. So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. \n\n \n\nTo be honest, I'm getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially Balco. I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.\n\nHaving said that, I'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while. The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\n", "label": "sport", "id": 945}, {"paragraph": "Radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs\n\nPaula Radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals.\n\nThe marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the \"suspicions and innuendoes\" which greet any fast time. \"Doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,\" the 30-year-old told the Sunday Times. \"It not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public.\"\n\nRadcliffe's comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. \"Being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,\" she added.\n\n\"The current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. \"This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. \"Often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. \"Having been on the receiving end of accusations like this I can testify as to how much this hurts.\"\n", "label": "sport", "id": 946}, {"paragraph": "Greek duo cleared in doping case\n\nSprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.\n\nThe duo had been provisionally suspended by the IAAF for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the Athens Olympics. But the Greek Athletics Federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the IAAF can now contest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The pair's former coach, Christos Tzekos, has been banned for four years. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.\n\nThe pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee's demand that the IAAF investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the Greek tribunal. The head of that tribunal, Kostas Panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in Athens. \"The charge cannot be substantiated,\" he said. \"In no way was he (Kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. The same goes for Thanou.\" Kenteris's lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: \"The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.\n\n\"He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January. \"This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. It shows he has no case to answer. \"Mr Kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. \"He has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures.\" But the IAAF said it was \"very surprised\" by the verdict. Spokesman Nick Davies said: \"We note the decision of the Greek authorities with interest. \"Our doping review board will now consider the English version of the decision.\"\n", "label": "sport", "id": 947}, {"paragraph": "Van Nistelrooy set to return\n\nManchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday.\n\nHe has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February. But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front.

Six candidates were interviewed for the job, including Denise Lewis' coach Charles van Commenee and former British triple jumper Keith Connor. \"We've searched long and hard to ensure we have found the right person,\" said UKA chief executive David Moorcroft. \"We have thoroughly tested the candidates. I believe David will make a great leader and I have great faith in what he will achieve.\" Collins said: \"It's a great challenge. Over the next few months I will spend time listening to those who already make a significant contribution to athletics and other elite sports in the UK.\" Collins, who has worked with javelin thrower Steve Backley in the past, started his career as a Royal Marine before becoming a PE teacher. He is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at Edinburgh University, where he helps competitors across many sports, including rugby, athletics, judo and football.\n\nHe has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the Great Britain women's curling team, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mark Lewis-Francis sought Collins' advice in Athens when he was looking for inspiration before he ran the final leg of Britain's surprise triumph in the 4x100m relay. Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate. He arrives with British athletics at a crossroads. Despite Kelly Holmes' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad, the GB team failed to live up to expectations in Athens. Many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers, and Britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in Italy this year. Collins will not have day-to-day coaching contact with the athletes, but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching set-up in order to secure medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in Sir Andrew Foster's review of the sport, which was published in May. It was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, which wanted UK Athletics to justify funding of more than \u00a340m from the Government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 World Championships, which are now being held in Helsinki. Van Commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the Dutch Olympic Committee, while Connor's application was rejected after an arduous interview process. Foster, however, declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made. \"The appointment of David Collins, with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience, is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process,\" he said.\n", "label": "sport", "id": 949}, {"paragraph": "IAAF will contest Greek decision\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.\n\nThe high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the Greek Athletics Federation (Segas) last month. Now the IAAF will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and has suspended both athletes. An IAAF statement said: \"The Doping Review Board concluded that the decision is erroneous.\" The statement continued: \"Both athletes' cases will be refered to arbitration before the CAS. The decision in both cases will be final and binding.\"\n\nSegas said the IAAF appeal was \"expected\" and \"understandable.\" \"Now we are going to await the final result, which we cannot prejudge,\" said Segas chairman Vassilis Sevastis. Kenteris, who won Olympic 200m gold at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou were suspended by the IAAF last December after failing to take routine drugs tests before the Athens Games. However, the independent tribunal overturned those bans, clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.\n\nKenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis described the IAAF's decision as \"not unexpected\" but told BBC Sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly. \"The IAAF's timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions,\" said Ioannidis. \"The IAAF has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.\n\n\"We have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth.\" Kenteris and Thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer's Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.

Part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. Kenteris insisted: \"The accident happened. I went crazy when I found out I had supposedly missed a test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic village.\" Kenteris, speaking on Greece's Alter Television station, also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. \"I told the hospital, which was an Olympics-accredited hospital, to call the IOC and have me tested on the spot but no-one came.\"\n\nAfter a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in Greece as Athens prepared for the start of the Athens Games, Kenteris and Thanou eventually withdrew. But Kenteris has continually protested his innocence - and on Sunday blamed Greek Olympic Committee officials and his former coach Christos Tzekos for failing to inform him of the test. The 31-year-old insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name. \"If a decision is taken to have charges filed against me, I will accept it gladly. \"A prosecution means that the case will be cleared...

Founded by the emperor Trajan around A.D, 100, the city, also known as Timgad or Tamugas, was located in the North African province of Mumidia.\n\nHome to veterans of the Third Augustan Legion, Thamugadi flourished for hundreds of years, becoming prosperous and thus an attractive target for raiders. After a Vandal invasion in 430, repeated attacks weakened the city, which never fully recovered and was abandoned during the 700s.\n\nThe desert sands swept in and buried Thamugadi. One thousand years would pass before the city received a visit from a team of explorers led by a maverick Scotsman in the 1700s. (See also: This warrior was the best of ancient Rome's 'five good emperors')\n\nStatesman and scholar\nBest known now for his contested discovery of the source of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, Scottish nobleman James Bruce was serving as the British consul in the coastal city of Algiers (today the capital of Algeria) in 1763.\n\nImposingly tall and broad, Bruce was a voracious scholar with a curious mind. Before his arrival in Algiers to take up his post, he spent a few months in Italy poring over the history of the African region and its role in antiquity.\n\nBruce\u2019s short temper and strong opinions soon led to clashes with his superiors in London. In 1765, he lost his appointment. Rather than return to Britain, he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani embarked on an adventure across Africa. On their journey, they kept notes and made illustrations depicting the many extraordinary people and places they encountered.\n\n\nTime in the desert\nIn the early stages of this odyssey, they had traveled south to the Algerian desert looking for traces of ancient civilizations. Bruce and Balugani had already seen several Roman ruins as they explored more remote parts of the region.\n\nOn December 12, 1765, they reached what they identified as Thamugadi. Many believe that they were the first Europeans in centuries to visit the site, near the northern slopes of the Aure\u0300s mountains. \u201cIt has been a small town, but full of elegant buildings,\u201d Bruce wrote in his diaries. He was confident that these ruins were what remained of the city founded by Trajan more than a millenium earlier.\n\nOn the first day, Bruce recorded and Balugani drew \u201cthe triumphal arch\u201d of Trajan. They returned the next day to continue exploration and identified an amphitheater. Bruce cleared away the sand and uncovered sculptures of the Roman emperor who succeeded Hadrian in A.D. 138, Antoninus Pius, and his wife, Faustina the Elder, works he described as having \u201cexquisite beauty.\u201d (See also: Trajan's Column Soars Over Rome)\n\nBruce reburied the sculptures in the sand and continued traveling. He documented more sites throughout North Africa and Ethiopia, even claiming to find the source of the Blue Nile. Balugani died in 1770, and Bruce returned to London in 1774. When he reported his findings, they were greeted with skepticism and disbelief. Incredulous at this reaction, Bruce retired to Scotland. In 1780, he began writing a memoir of his time in Africa, a five-volume work known as Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile. The book was published in 1790. When Bruce died four years later, much of Britain still refused to recognize his achievements.\n\nRoman splendor\nThamugadi lay largely forgotten in the desert sands until 1875, when it was visited by Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain\u2019s consul in Algiers. In his 1877 book, Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce in Algeria and Tunis, Playfair paid homage to his consular predecessor, visiting some of the sites Bruce had recorded.\n\nPlayfair\u2019s description of Thamugadi offers more details than Bruce\u2019s. His observations revealed the city\u2019s regional importance, noting it was built at the intersection of six Roman roads. In Playfair\u2019s opinion, the architecture outshone that of the neighboring Roman city Lambaesis, Nubia\u2019s military capital. Playfair concluded that Thamugadi was a \u201ccenter of commercial and agricultural activity.\u201d (See also: On this ancient map, all roads really do lead to Rome)\n\nHe also admired the magnificence of the city\u2019s Arch of Trajan. On the ground underneath its 20-foot-high portal can still be seen deep ruts from the traffic that passed into the city along the busy imperial highways.\n\nThe French took control of the site in 1881, a few years after Playfair\u2019s visit, and maintained a presence there until 1960. During this period, the site was systematically excavated. Having been buried for centuries under sand with nothing built on top of it, Thamugadi is one of only a few Roman cities excavated in its entirety.\n\nGoing with the grain\nThe research undertaken by Playfair and by French scholars has enabled historians to piece together the history of the city. Originally named Colonia Marciana Trajana Thamurga, in honor of Emperor Trajan\u2019s sister, Thamugadi was laid out in a grid.\n\nIn the mid-third century A.D., the city\u2019s population peaked at 15,000. They enjoyed fine public buildings, including a magnificent library and a total of 14 baths. The comfort of Thamugadi\u2019s facilities, and the presence of mosaics, has often prompted comparisons with Pompeii. (See also: Vesuvius: Asleep for Now)\n\nThe city\u2019s location was key to protecting the Roman Empire\u2019s southern borders. North Africa was a center of grain production, and Rome\u2019s Third Augustan Legion was stationed in Thamugadi to protect the grain and its transport to Rome. Several hundred men would be discharged from the legion every two years, and they settled in Thamugadi as a kind of pension for their service. Their presence also served as a deterrent to invaders.\n\nThe city was a manifestation of Roman might on the empire\u2019s southern border. Its diverse population saw those who worshipped the old gods living alongside Christians. For a while, it was a stronghold of the heretical Christian sect the Donatists.\n\nThe general crisis mounting on the borders of the Roman Empire eventually took its toll on Thamugadi. After being looted by the Vandals during the fifth century, the city began to sink into ruin. After the fall of the western Roman Empire, Thamugadi enjoyed a brief resurgence as a Christian center, and a fort was built outside the city in 539. But the city was abandoned either before or during the Arab invasions of the 700s. (See also: Rome's border walls were the beginning of its end)\n\nFrom that point, the Sahara gradually covered Thamugadi, and it stayed hidden for a thousand years until James Bruce and others would rediscover its buried glory.

But the term is actually a misnomer and points to a key fact: nations involved in World War I didn\u2019t accurately report their flu outbreaks. \n\nSpain remained neutral throughout World War I and its press freely reported its flu cases, including when the Spanish king Alfonso XIII contracted it in the spring of 1918.

The most notable instance was the Battle of Algiers, which began on September 30, 1956, when three women, including Djamila Bouhired and Zohra Drif, simultaneously placed bombs at three sites including the downtown office of Air France. The FLN carried out shootings and bombings in the spring of 1957, resulting in civilian casualties and a crushing response from the authorities.\n\nGeneral Jacques Massu was instructed to use whatever methods deemed necessary to restore order in the city and to find and eliminate terrorists. Using paratroopers, he broke the strike and, in the succeeding months, destroyed the FLN infrastructure in Algiers. But the FLN had succeeded in showing its ability to strike at the heart of French Algeria and to assemble a mass response to its demands among urban Muslims. The publicity given to the brutal methods used by the army to win the Battle of Algiers, including the use of torture, strong movement control and curfew called quadrillage and where all authority was under the military, created doubt in France about its role in Algeria. What was originally \"pacification\" or a \"public order operation\" had turned into a colonial war accompanied by torture.\n\nGuerrilla war\nDuring 1956 and 1957, the FLN successfully applied hit-and-run tactics in accordance with guerrilla warfare theory. Whilst some of this was aimed at military targets, a significant amount was invested in a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage French authority. This resulted in acts of sadistic torture and brutal violence against all, including women and children. Specializing in ambushes and night raids and avoiding direct contact with superior French firepower, the internal forces targeted army patrols, military encampments, police posts, and colonial farms, mines, and factories, as well as transportation and communications facilities. Once an engagement was broken off, the guerrillas merged with the population in the countryside, in accordance with Mao's theories. Kidnapping was commonplace, as were the ritual murder and mutilation of civilians[55][dubious \u2013 discuss] (see Torture section).\n\nAlthough successfully provoking fear and uncertainty within both communities in Algeria, the revolutionaries' coercive tactics suggested that they had not yet inspired the bulk of the Muslim people to revolt against French colonial rule. Gradually, however, the FLN gained control in certain sectors of the Aur\u00e8s, the Kabylie, and other mountainous areas around Constantine and south of Algiers and Oran. In these places, the FLN established a simple but effective\u2014although frequently temporary\u2014military administration that was able to collect taxes and food and to recruit manpower. But it was never able to hold large, fixed positions.\n\nThe loss of competent field commanders both on the battlefield and through defections and political purges created difficulties for the FLN. Moreover, power struggles in the early years of the war split leadership in the wilayat, particularly in the Aur\u00e8s. Some officers created their own fiefdoms, using units under their command to settle old scores and engage in private wars against military rivals within the FLN.\nFrench counter-insurgency operations\nDespite complaints from the military command in Algiers, the French government was reluctant for many months to admit that the Algerian situation was out of control and that what was viewed officially as a pacification operation had developed into a war. By 1956, there were more than 400,000 French troops in Algeria. Although the elite colonial infantry airborne units and the Foreign Legion bore the brunt of offensive counterinsurgency combat operations, approximately 170,000 Muslim Algerians also served in the regular French army, most of them volunteers. France also sent air force and naval units to the Algerian theater, including helicopters. In addition to service as a flying ambulance and cargo carrier, French forces utilized the helicopter for the first time in a ground attack role in order to pursue and destroy fleeing FLN guerrilla units. The American military later used the same helicopter combat methods in the Vietnam War. The French also used napalm,[56] which was depicted for the first time in the 2007 film L'Ennemi intime (Intimate Enemies) by Florent Emilio Siri.[56]\n\nThe French army resumed an important role in local Algerian administration through the Special Administration Section (Section Administrative Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, SAS), created in 1955. The SAS's mission was to establish contact with the Muslim population and weaken nationalist influence in the rural areas by asserting the \"French presence\" there. SAS officers\u2014called k\u00e9pis bleus (blue caps)\u2014also recruited and trained bands of loyal Muslim irregulars, known as harkis. Armed with shotguns and using guerrilla tactics similar to those of the FLN, the harkis, who eventually numbered about 180,000 volunteers, more than the FLN activists,[57] were an ideal instrument of counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nHarkis were mostly used in conventional formations, either in all-Algerian units commanded by French officers or in mixed units. Other uses included platoon or smaller size units, attached to French battalions, in a similar way as the Kit Carson Scouts by the U.S. in Vietnam. A third use was an intelligence gathering role, with some reported minor pseudo-operations in support of their intelligence collection.[58] U.S. military expert Lawrence E. Cline stated, \"The extent of these pseudo-operations appears to have been very limited both in time and scope. ... The most widespread use of pseudo type operations was during the 'Battle of Algiers' in 1957. The principal French employer of covert agents in Algiers was the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch. \"The Fifth Bureau\" made extensive use of 'turned' FLN members, one such network being run by Captain Paul-Alain Leger of the 10th Paras. \"Persuaded\" to work for the French forces included by the use of torture and threats against their family; these agents \"mingled with FLN cadres. They planted incriminating forged documents, spread false rumors of treachery and fomented distrust. ... As a frenzy of throat-cutting and disemboweling broke out among confused and suspicious FLN cadres, nationalist slaughtered nationalist from April to September 1957 and did France's work for her.\"[59] But this type of operation involved individual operatives rather than organized covert units.\n\nOne organized pseudo-guerrilla unit, however, was created in December 1956 by the French DST domestic intelligence agency. The Organization of the French Algerian Resistance (ORAF), a group of counter-terrorists had as its mission to carry out false flag terrorist attacks with the aim of quashing any hopes of political compromise.[60] But it seemed that, as in Indochina, \"the French focused on developing native guerrilla groups that would fight against the FLN\", one of whom fought in the Southern Atlas Mountains, equipped by the French Army.[61]\n\nThe FLN also used pseudo-guerrilla strategies against the French Army on one occasion, with Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French. But most of these members were either already FLN members or were turned by the FLN once enlisted. Corpses of purported FLN members displayed by the unit were in fact those of dissidents and members of other Algerian groups killed by the FLN. The French Army finally discovered the war ruse and tried to hunt down Force K members. However, some 600 managed to escape and join the FLN with weapons and equipment.[61][16]:255\u20137\n\nLate in 1957, General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in Algeria, instituted a system of quadrillage (surveillance using a grid pattern), dividing the country into sectors, each permanently garrisoned by troops responsible for suppressing rebel operations in their assigned territory. Salan's methods sharply reduced the instances of FLN terrorism but tied down a large number of troops in static defense. Salan also constructed a heavily patrolled system of barriers to limit infiltration from Tunisia and Morocco. The best known of these was the Morice Line (named for the French defense minister, Andr\u00e9 Morice), which consisted of an electrified fence, barbed wire, and mines over a 320-kilometer stretch of the Tunisian border.\nThe French military command ruthlessly applied the principle of collective responsibility to villages suspected of sheltering, supplying, or in any way cooperating with the guerrillas. Villages that could not be reached by mobile units were subject to aerial bombardment. FLN guerrillas that fled to caves or other remote hiding places were tracked and hunted down. In one episode, FLN guerrillas who refused to surrender and withdraw from a cave complex were dealt with by French Foreign Legion Pioneer troops, who, lacking flamethrowers or explosives, simply bricked up each cave, leaving the residents to die of suffocation.[62]\n\nFinding it impossible to control all of Algeria's remote farms and villages, the French government also initiated a program of concentrating large segments of the rural population, including whole villages, in camps under military supervision to prevent them from aiding the rebels. In the three years (1957\u201360) during which the regroupement program was followed, more than 2 million Algerians[24] were removed from their villages, mostly in the mountainous areas, and resettled in the plains, where it was difficult to reestablish their previous economic and social systems. Living conditions in the fortified villages were poor. In hundreds of villages, orchards and croplands not already burned by French troops went to seed for l", "label": "historical", "id": 964}, {"paragraph": "The Coolest Ancient Ruins in Algeria, Africa\nA melting pot of cultural influences, Algeria is a highly underrated North African tourist destination that has a lot to offer the historically, and culturally, minded traveler. With a veritable treasure trove of past influences ranging from French to Spanish and Berber to Roman, it\u2019s no wonder the ruins here are almost as good as the architecture that still remains. Predominantly Roman, take your pick from our list of the eight coolest ancient ruins to visit in Algeria.\nKhemissa\nThe home to a well-preserved and little-visited Roman theater rather grandly called Thubursicum Numidarum, Khemissa is a town in north eastern Algeria which is well worth a visit if you\u2019re hunting for an in-the-know spot. The ruins, what are left of the old Roman town which was once there, have merged with the landscape, adding to the beauty and the drama of the hillside location which looks out onto Khemissa itself. The view from the small old forum is amazing, and the well-formed and still intact arches are truly impressive.\n\nRuines de Khemissa, Algeria, North Africa\nTimgad\nRather grandly titled the \u2018Pompeii of Africa,\u2019 and UNESCO World Heritage recognized, Timgad is a fantastic example of a Roman colonial town that is a regularly recommended Algerian tourist attraction. Set in the lush hills of the northern Aur\u00e8s Mountains, some of the must see points of interest at this fascinating sight include the Trajan Arch, which was restored at some point in the second century, and the Capitoline Temple. The latter is dedicated to Jupiter and is approximately the same size as the Pantheon in Rome, to give you some impression of the grandeur of this place. It is also one of the best examples of the logistics of Roman town planning, if that\u2019s the kind of thing that floats your boat.\n\nTimgad, Algeria, North Africa\n\nQal\u2019a of Beni Hammad\nMoving briefly away from Roman ruins, the Qal\u2019a of Beni Hammad was in the 11th century the first capital city of the Hammadid rulers. Not much survives of this fortified city, however the little that does is an intriguing insight into what life may have been like before the abandonment of it in 1900 due to the threat of a Hilalian invasion. Officially recognised by UNESCO in 1980, this archaeological site is set at a height of 1000m above sea level and is surrounded by an impressively beautiful mountainous setting. As one of the most precisely dated complexes of the Islamic civilization, the Qal\u2019a of Beni Hammad is also home to the second oldest minaret in the country and a testament to the past palatial culture of North Africa.\n\nQal\u2019a of Beni Hannad, Algeria, North Africa\n\nTipaza\nPreviously known as Tipasa, this is another of Algeria\u2019s most famed Roman ruins and with good reason. Constructed on three small hills, overlooking the ocean, it was a small trading-post of much commercial, but little cultural, importance in Roman Algeria. However, this cultural unimportance has long since been banished to the past, as Tipaza boasts a unique amalgamation of Phoenician, Roman, palaeochristian and Byzantine ruins, alongside indigenous monuments. This is according to the UNESCO World Heritage Site website, to which Tipaza was inaugurated in 1982. Aside from all this historical interest, the pristine Mediterranean beach location doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nTipaza, Algeria, North Africa\n\nLambaesis\nAmong some of the most interesting and perhaps lesser-known ruins in northern Africa, we have the Roman ruin of Lambaesis, situated next to the modern village of Tazoult. Similarly to Timgad, it is located in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains and is also home to arches, baths and even aqueducts. However, this garrison town is well worth a visit for the gem that is the praetorium of the Third Augustan Legion alone. This commandant\u2019s house dates from around 268 and dominates the site of the modern day ruins of Lambaesis, which was once the capital of the Roman province, Numidia.\n\nLambaesis, Algeria, North Africa\n\nTiddis\nOne of Algeria\u2019s most beautiful and well-preserved Roman archaeological sites, the Roman town of Tiddis is a rarely visited spot by travelers, making it one of the country\u2019s coolest ruins to check out. Tiny in size, but grand in history, Tiddis is also the home to a temple of Mithra, the ancient Persian god of light and wisdom, cisterns and archways and is very close to the visually stunning \u2018city of bridges,\u2019 Constantine. However, unlike many Roman towns, Tiddis is unusual for its use of winding pathways that climb the steep hillsides on which it is set. Archaeologists believe this to be because the site was originally a Berber settlement that was occupied and developed by the Romans during the first century.\n\nTiddis, Algeria, North Africa\n\nDjemila\nMeaning \u2018beautiful\u2019 in Arabic, Djemila is just that. Of the trio of well-known Roman cities in Algeria, this one is undoubtedly the best known, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Set in the mountains of Setif, Djemila was formerly known as Cuicol and founded by Emperor Nerva Trajan in the first century. Arguably the most impressive feature of this ruin is the ornate, lavishly tiled museum that is incredibly well-maintained. Every inch of the ample walls is covered with mosaics, making for an intriguing and unmissable visual display. There are also a handful of elaborate houses, Byzantine churches and ancient temples on offer at these awesome Roman ruins. For its display of classical Roman architecture, Djemila easily warrants a spot in Algeria\u2019s coolest ruins.\n\nDjemila, Algeria, North Africa\n\nTlemcen National Park\nTo round off the list, we move to Tlemcen, \u2018the town of cherries.\u2019 This National Park is a recent addition to the national parks of Algeria, but it is one of the best as it includes not only expansive forests, cliffs and waterfalls, but also several archaeological sites, most notably that of Mansoura. Mansoura was the ancient city upon which the modern town of Tlemcen was built, and it\u2019s well worth checking out. The 13th-century ruins of this enormous ancient mosque are really imposing, giving you some sense of life in the ancient world and a remarkable introduction to the architectural magnificence of it. If Mansoura doesn\u2019t interest you though, the mausoleum of Sidi Boumediene, a 12th-century Sufi leader, is also situated within Tlemcen national park.\n\nTlemcen National Park, Algeria, North Africa", "label": "historical", "id": 965}, {"paragraph": "World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939\u201345.

The war was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I. The 40,000,000\u201350,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history.\n\nAlong with World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union\u2019s power to nations of eastern Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nAxis Initiative And Allied Reaction\nThe outbreak of war\nBy the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23\u201324 to the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the U.S.S.R.\n\nHaving achieved this cynical agreement, the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol, Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland (to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him. Finally, at 12:40 PM on August 31, 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 AM and at 5:00 PM, respectively.

It was to be commemorated in 1964 with the release of the film Zulu, giving Michael Caine his first major screen role.\n\nBritain was intent on expanding its territory and influence in South Africa in the 1870s and had declared war on the Kingdom of Zululand. Rorke\u2019s Drift was a mission station near the border between the British colony of Natal and the Zulu Kingdom and had been occupied by British troops. When the battle began, though, only 139 soldiers were encamped there. They had no idea what lay in store.\n\nAt 4.20pm on January 22, 1879 a force of 4,000 Zulu warriors began to lay siege to the station. Their intermittent attacks were to last for almost twelve hours.\n\nFortunately for the British, although some of the Zulus had old muskets and antiquated rifles, most were armed only with a short spear called an assegai and a shield made of cowhide. So in weaponry they were no match for the highly trained soldiers with their (then) sophisticated rifles and firepower. But the manpower advantage lay massively in favour of the Zulus.\n\nBy 4am, after nearly 12 hours repulsing wave after wave of attacks involving hand-to-hand combat, a number of British soldiers lay dead. Most of the others were exhausted, rapidly running out of ammunition, and probably in no condition to repel another assault. But they didn\u2019t have to. As dawn broke they saw that the Zulus were gone, leaving behind a battleground littered with the dead and dying.

The index of military strength in September 1939 was the number of divisions that each nation could mobilize. Against Germany\u2019s 100 infantry divisions and six armoured divisions, France had 90 infantry divisions in metropolitan France, Great Britain had 10 infantry divisions, and Poland had 30 infantry divisions, 12 cavalry brigades, and one armoured brigade (Poland had also 30 reserve infantry divisions, but these could not be mobilized quickly). A division contained from 12,000 to 25,000 men.\n\nIt was the qualitative superiority of the German infantry divisions and the number of their armoured divisions that made the difference in 1939. The firepower of a German infantry division far exceeded that of a French, British, or Polish division; the standard German division included 442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers. Allied divisions had a firepower only slightly greater than that of World War I. Germany had six armoured divisions in September 1939; the Allies, though they had a large number of tanks, had no armoured divisions at that time.\n\nThe six armoured, or panzer, divisions of the Wehrmacht comprised some 2,400 tanks. And though Germany would subsequently expand its tank forces during the first years of the war, it was not the number of tanks that Germany had (the Allies had almost as many in September 1939) but the fact of their being organized into divisions and operated as such that was to prove decisive. In accordance with the doctrines of General Heinz Guderian, the German tanks were used in massed formations in conjunction with motorized artillery to punch holes in the enemy line and to isolate segments of the enemy, which were then surrounded and captured by motorized German infantry divisions while the tanks ranged forward to repeat the process: deep drives into enemy territory by panzer divisions were thus followed by mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. These tactics were supported by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy\u2019s supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing its defensive capabilities. Mechanization was the key to the German blitzkrieg, or \u201clightning war,\u201d so named because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its salient characteristics. Tested and well-trained in maneuvers, the German panzer divisions constituted a force with no equal in Europe.\n\nThe German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the best force of its kind in 1939. It was a ground-cooperation force designed to support the Army, but its planes were superior to nearly all Allied types. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939 the production of German combat aircraft steadily mounted. The table shows the production of German aircraft by years.\n\nThe standardization of engines and airframes gave the Luftwaffe an advantage over its opponents. Germany had an operational force of 1,000 fighters and 1,050 bombers in September 1939. The Allies actually had more planes in 1939 than Germany did, but their strength was made up of many different types, some of them obsolescent. The corresponding table shows the number of first-line military aircraft available to the Allies at the outbreak of war.\n\nGreat Britain, which was held back by delays in the rearmament program, was producing one modern fighter in 1939, the Hurricane. A higher-performance fighter, the Spitfire, was just coming into production and did not enter the air war in numbers until 1940.\n\nThe value of the French Air Force in 1939 was reduced by the number of obsolescent planes in its order of battle: 131 of the 634 fighters and nearly all of the 463 bombers. France was desperately trying to buy high-performance aircraft in the United States in 1939.\n\nAt sea the odds against Germany were much greater in September 1939 than in August 1914, since the Allies in 1939 had many more large surface warships than Germany had. At sea, however, there was to be no clash between the Allied and the German massed fleets but only the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders.\n\n", "label": "historical", "id": 968}, {"paragraph": "Prisoners of War\n\nWhat was the reality for prisoners of war in World War One? Dr Heather Jones looks beyond the propaganda to consider the facts around prisoner mistreatment, labour and death rates across Europe.\nThe image of prisoners behind barbed wire gazing at the camera taking their photograph is a striking one. Prisoners of war were central to the propaganda machine in the First World War, with belligerent states keen to circulate photographs that showed that they were treating their captives well. How a state treated its prisoners was taken as an indication of its level of cultural development and modernity \u2013 and all states accused their enemy of mistreating its prisoners.\n\nPrisoner mistreatment\nThese accusations were not all propaganda stories. Although the majority of the estimated eight to nine million men taken prisoner during the First World War survived the conflict, during the war there were a number of serious episodes of prisoner mistreatment. In 1914, Germany captured far more prisoners of war than Britain or France. By 1915, Germany held over a million prisoners of war. Germany expected a short war and it was not prepared for these numerous soldiers captured on both Germany\u2019s Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1914, prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front often had to sleep in fields, where they suffered from exposure, while they waited for their camps to be built. The prisoners were also used as labour to build the camps.\n\nIn Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia in 1915, prisoner of war camps were often unsanitary and that year a severe typhus epidemic broke out which cost the lives of thousands of prisoners. In Mauthausen camp in Austria-Hungary in January 1915, up to 186 prisoners a day died of typhus. Typhus also broke out in many camps in camps in the Russian empire: in winter 1915-16, typhus ravaged Totskoe camp where at least 10,000 men died out of 25,000. The typhus epidemic led to the development of better hygiene conditions in prisoner of war camps in Germany, with modern latrines, disinfection vats to remove lice from clothing and shower or bath houses built for the prisoners.\n\nReprisals also resulted in prisoner mistreatment. In 1916, Germany sent newly captured British and French prisoners to carry out forced labour on the Eastern Front in a reprisal action for the French sending German prisoners of war to camps in North Africa and the British using German prisoners as workers for the British army in France. These Eastern Front reprisals were horrific and many prisoners died of cold and starvation. In 1917, Germany kept British and French prisoners of war on the Western Front in dangerous locations, carrying out forced labour. This was a reprisal for the British and French using forced German prisoner labour on the Western Front: the French had forced German prisoners to work under shellfire for months on the Verdun battlefield. These reprisals marked a significant escalation in prisoner of war\n\nLabour\nThe image of prisoners of war behind barbed wire in the prisoner of war camp was one of the most widespread images of the war. However, it was also rather misleading as by 1915 states and armies had started to think differently about how best to house and treat prisoners. The large prisoner of war camp on a country\u2019s Home Front was only one place that prisoners were held. From 1915 on, Germany began to send prisoners to live and work in small working units in agriculture, forestry or mining \u2013 industries badly short of manpower due to the war effort. Russia and France also began to use prisoner labour on a massive scale: in Russia, working conditions varied very widely, with the worst occurring during the construction of the Murman railway during which an estimated 25,000 out of the 70,000 mainly Austro-Hungarian and German prisoner of war work force died. Britain, however, delayed using widespread prisoner labour on the home front until 1917 because of trade union opposition.\n\nPrisoner labour was key to the war effort of many states. Overall by 1916, across Europe most non-officer prisoners of war, whom it was legal for the captor to put to work under international law, were working, some returning to the prisoner of war camp at night, others lodged under guard near to their place of work. For those housed outside the camp conditions could vary considerably. While prisoner of war camps were inspected during the war by the International Red Cross , working units outside the camp were rarely inspected. The worst camps, however, were those run by armies near the front line. By 1916, the British, French, German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies were all keeping permanent units of prisoners as forced labourers for the army at or near the front. These men had to work under shellfire and live in desolate, unhygienic conditions. In some armies, such as the German army in 1918, they were\n\nDeath rates\nDeath rates varied for different prisoner nationalities during the war: 100,000 of the 600,000 Italian prisoners captured by the Central Powers died. Romanian prisoners in German camps had a death rate of 29%. Serbs held by Austria-Hungary or British prisoners captured by the Ottoman Empire also had very high death rates. In contrast, German prisoners captured by Britain had death rates of 3%. While most prisoners survived the war, and camps in Western European countries were generally quite good, for certain nationalities captivity was more dangerous than serving at the front. The image of the well-run prisoner of war camp is thus not representative of the experience of all prisoners during the war.", "label": "historical", "id": 969}, {"paragraph": "Giza Pyramids\n\nThe Giza Pyramids are that kind of historical site that just blows your mind. The tallest of the three, the Great Pyramid of Khufu, towers above the desert at 481 feet. It was the tallest building on the planet for over 3800 years, until the construction of England\u2019s Lincoln Cathedral in 1300.\n\nThe three Giza Pyramids are located on the outskirts of Cairo. They were built between 2550 and 2490 BC to serve as a mortuary temple for Pharaohs Khufu, Khefre, and Menkaure. Exactly how the Pyramids were built, and by whom, remains a mystery today.\n\nFor years it was believed to be the work of slaves. But it is now thought that the builders were probably skilled workers from all over the country. The enigmatic Sphinx was built by Khefre, and its meaning is still debated among historians.\n\nYou can tour the inside of two of the pyramids during your visit. One of the three is always closed, in order to limit the impact of tourism on these ancient structures.\n\nSaqqara & Dhashur\nGiza is what immediately comes to mind when most people think about pyramids, and the fact that such amazing structures were built 4500 years ago is truly mind-blowing. Yet, just a few miles away, there are some pyramids that are even older.\n\nThe pyramids in Saqqara and Dhashur were built around 200 years before those at Giza. Saqqara and Dhashur were the necropolises of Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. They\u2019re now a true treasure trove for archaeologists and anyone interested in Egyptian history.\n\nSome of the most notable structures here include the Pyramid of Djoser (or Step Pyramid), the 80-ton alabaster sphinx, and the Bent and Red Pyramid. What\u2019s even better, they all see far fewer tourists than Giza!\n\n\nKarnak Temple\nMoving south from Cairo, the expedition continues on to Luxor. Here you\u2019ll travel forward in time, leaving the mysteries of the Ancient Kingdom for the grandeur of the Middle and New Kingdom.\n\nLuxor was constructed on the same site of Ancient Thebes, which was the capital of Egypt from approximately 2000 BC onwards.\n\nOne of the most notable sites in Luxor is Karnak Temple, a vast complex of temples and palaces. It was built in dedication to three Egyptian gods\u2013 Amun, Mut, and Khonsu\u2013 and gradually enlarged over a period of two thousand years.\n\nKarnak Temple is the largest religious building ever constructed, covering a surface of 200 acres. The largest section is the Hypostyle Hall, which encompasses 54,000 square feet and features 134 columns, making it the biggest room of any religious building in the world. \n\nLuxor Temple\nLocated about 1.5 miles from Karnak, you\u2019ll find the world-renowned Luxor Temple. This is another spectacular complex of temples and shrines built by several pharaohs, and dedicated to the \u201cTheban triad\u201d of gods mentioned above.\n\nKarnak and Luxor Temples were once joined by an avenue lined with sphinxes, which has been partially unearthed. Walking down this avenue in the early morning mist (or after sunset, when it\u2019s all lit up) will make you feel as if you\u2019re stepping in the footsteps of ancient history.\n\nAnother notable feature of Luxor Temple is that it\u2019s been used almost continuously for worship. A Coptic church was built on the site after Christianity spread to Egypt, and in subsequent centuries a mosque was erected, which is still in use today.\n\nValley of the Kings\nThe Karnak and Luxor temples lie on the East Bank of the Nile\u2013 the City of the Living, where the city of Thebes once stood. The West Bank was always the City of the Dead, where cemeteries, mortuary temples, and mausoleums were (and still are) located.\n\nAnother spectacular ancient site in Luxor is the Valley of the Kings, where pharaohs were buried for over 500 years. The tombs consist of a series of underground chambers, which are beautifully decorated with wall paintings and hieroglyphs, ending with the room where the pharaohs\u2019 mummies were placed in a sarcophagus.\n\nMost of the sarcophagi and mummies now lie in Cairo\u2019s Egyptian Museum, with the exception of King Tutankhamun.\n\nTemple of Hatshepsut\nThis temple is located just a short drive away from the Valley of the Kings. It was built to honor of Hatshepsut, one of the few female pharaohs in Egyptian history.\n\nThe temple is noteworthy because of its architecture: It has three levels with colonnaded terraces, and it\u2019s built in a style reminiscent of the Greek and Roman classical architecture that emerged a thousand years later!\n\nThe various levels feature decorated columns, carvings, and hieroglyphs.\n\nTemple of Hathor\nFrom Luxor, we\u2019ll embark on a four-day Nile cruise to Aswan, taking in some of the best ancient Egyptian historical sites located along the great river.\n\nThe first stop will be the Temple of Hathor at Denderah, one of the best-preserved temple complexes in all of Egypt. It features a maze of underground passages, plus walls decorated with carvings and reliefs that still retain surprisingly vivid colors.\n\nOne of the best-known bas-reliefs is the Denderah Zodiac, which is located on the roof of a chapel and depicts images of Taurus and Libra. The relief in the temple is actually a replica: The original now resides in the Louvre in Paris.\n\nTemple of Horus\nAnother stunning temple located in the vicinity of the Nile is the Temple of Horus in Edfu.\n\nThis is very well-preserved site because it\u2019s far more recent than the Luxor and Karnak Temples. It was completed in the Ptolemaic period, between 237 and 57 BC. Another reason why this temple is in such good condition is that it was buried in sand for hundreds of years, which contributed to preserving the carvings and wall paintings inside.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Horus, the falcon god, who is frequently portrayed in statues and wall decorations around the site. It is also one of the few temples to survive with an intact ceiling.\n\nTemple of Kom Ombo\nNot far from the Temple of Horus, there\u2019s also the Kom Ombo Temple, one of the most unusual Egyptian historical sites.\n\nKom Ombo is known as a \u201cdouble temple,\u201d as it was dedicated to two different sets of gods. The southern part of the temple is dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, the god of fertility and creator of the world, and the northern side is in honor of Horus.\n\nThe two parts of the temple are exactly symmetrical, which is a true rarity in ancient Egyptian architecture.\n\nAbu Simbel\nAfter reaching Aswan, we\u2019ll fly to Abu Simbel, a temple complex in the far south of Egypt. There, twin temples were carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, and dedicated to the great pharaoh Ramesses II and his wife.\n\nThe most recognizable feature of both temples are the colossal statues you\u2019ll find at the entrance. The Ramesses II ones reach up to 65 feet.\n\nAbu Simbel is unique because the two temples were about to disappear under the water of the Aswan High Dam forever before an international task force arranged to have them relocated.\n\nThe process ultimately took five years. The two temples were carefully cut and reassembled in a safe location far away from the dam waters, in what proved one of the most challenging projects of modern engineering. \u2013Margherita Ragg", "label": "historical", "id": 970}, {"paragraph": "From Abu Simbel to the Valley of the Kings\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of traveling to Egypt, there\u2019s never been a better time. The country has suffered a long-lasting tourism drought due in large part to the Arab Spring. But nowadays, though the political situation is stable and the country is once again open for business, western tourists remain few and far between.\n\nThose who do choose to tour Egypt will be rewarded far beyond their expectations. There are incredible archaeological ruins dating back thousands of years, museums filled with priceless exhibits, stunning desert landscapes, and the magical River Nile, the true beating heart of this wonderful country.\n\nYou could spend months visiting all the ancient Egyptian historical sites found all over the country, from the Mediterranean and Red Sea coast to the Sudanese border in the south.

In the Cameroons (German: Kamerun), invaded by Allied forces from the south, the east, and the northwest in August 1914 and attacked from the sea in the west, the Germans put up a more effective resistance, and the last German stronghold there, Mora, held out until February 18, 1916.\n\nOperations by South African forces in huge numerical superiority were launched against German South West Africa (Namibia) in September 1914 but were held up by the pro-German rebellion of certain South African officers who had fought against the British in the South African War of 1899\u20131902. The rebellion died out in February 1915, but the Germans in South West Africa nevertheless did not capitulate until July 9.\n\nIn Jiaozhou (Kiaochow) Bay a small German enclave on the Chinese coast, the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao) was the object of Japanese attack from September 1914. With some help from British troops and from Allied warships, the Japanese captured it on November 7. In October, meanwhile, the Japanese had occupied the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshalls in the North Pacific, these islands being defenseless since the departure of Admiral von Spee\u2019s naval squadron.\n\nIn the South Pacific, Western Samoa (now Samoa) fell without blood at the end of August 1914 to a New Zealand force supported by Australian, British, and French warships. In September an Australian invasion of Neu-Pommern (New Britain) won the surrender of the whole colony of German New Guinea within a few weeks.\n\nThe story of German East Africa (comprising present-day Rwanda, Burundi, and continental Tanzania) was very different, thanks to the quality of the local askaris (European-trained African troops) and to the military genius of the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. A landing of troops from India was repelled with ignominy by the Germans in November 1914. A massive invasion from the north, comprising British and colonial troops under the South African J.C. Smuts, was launched in February 1916, to be coordinated with a Belgian invasion from the west and with an independent British one from Nyasaland in the south, but, though Dar es Salaam fell to Smuts and Tabora to the Belgians in September, Lettow-Vorbeck maintained his small force in being. In November 1917 he began to move southward across Portuguese East Africa (Germany had declared war on Portugal in March 1916), and, after crossing back into German East Africa in September 1918, he turned southwestward to invade Northern Rhodesia in October. Having taken Kasama on November 9 (two days before the German armistice in Europe), he finally surrendered on November 25. With some 12,000 men at the outset, he eventually tied down 130,000 or more Allied", "label": "historical", "id": 972}, {"paragraph": "Week of barricades\n\nConvinced that de Gaulle had betrayed them, some units of European volunteers (Unit\u00e9s Territoriales) in Algiers led by student leaders Pierre Lagaillarde and Jean-Jacques Susini, caf\u00e9 owner Joseph Ortiz, and lawyer Jean-Baptiste Biaggi staged an insurrection in the Algerian capital starting on 24 January 1960, and known in France as La semaine des barricades (\"the week of barricades\"). The ultras incorrectly believed that they would be supported by General Massu. The insurrection order was given by Colonel Jean Garde of the Fifth Bureau. As the army, police, and supporters stood by, civilian pieds-noirs threw up barricades in the streets and seized government buildings. General Maurice Challe, responsible for the army in Algeria, declared Algiers under siege, but forbade the troops to fire on the insurgents. Nevertheless, 20 rioters were killed during shooting on Boulevard Laferri\u00e8re. Eight arrest warrants were issued in Paris against the initiators of the insurrection. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a member of parliament and future Front national founder, who called for the barricades to be extended to Paris, and theoretician Georges Sauge were then placed under custody.[64]\n\nIn Paris on 29 January 1960, de Gaulle called on his ineffective army to remain loyal and rallied popular support for his Algerian policy in a televised address:\n\nI took, in the name of France, the following decision\u2014the Algerians will have the free choice of their destiny. When, in one way or another \u2013 by ceasefire or by complete crushing of the rebels \u2013 we will have put an end to the fighting, when, after a prolonged period of appeasement, the population will have become conscious of the stakes and, thanks to us, realised the necessary progress in political, economic, social, educational, and other domains. Then it will be the Algerians who will tell us what they want to be.... Your French of Algeria, how can you listen to the liars and the conspirators who tell you that, if you grant free choice to the Algerians, France and de Gaulle want to abandon you, retreat from Algeria, and deliver you to the rebellion?.... I say to all of our soldiers: your mission comprises neither equivocation nor interpretation. You have to liquidate the rebellious forces, which want to oust France from Algeria and impose on this country its dictatorship of misery and sterility.... Finally, I address myself to France. Well, well, my dear and old country, here we face together, once again, a serious ordeal. In virtue of the mandate that the people have given me and of the national legitimacy, which I have incarned for 20 years, I ask everyone to support me whatever happens.[65]\n\nMost of the Army heeded his call, and the siege of Algiers ended on 1 February with Lagaillarde surrendering to General Challe's command of the French Army in Algeria. The loss of many ultra leaders who were imprisoned or transferred to other areas did not deter the French Algeria militants. Sent to prison in Paris and then paroled, Lagaillarde fled to Spain. There, with another French army officer, Raoul Salan, who had entered clandestinely, and with Jean-Jacques Susini, he created the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (Secret Army Organization, OAS) on December 3, 1960, with the purpose of continuing the fight for French Algeria. Highly organized and well-armed, the OAS stepped up its terrorist activities, which were directed against both Algerians and pro-government French citizens, as the move toward negotiated settlement of the war and self-determination gained momentum. To the FLN rebellion against France were added civil wars between extremists in the two communities and between the ultras and the French government in Algeria.\n\nBeside Pierre Lagaillarde, Jean-Baptiste Biaggi was also imprisoned, while Alain de S\u00e9rigny was arrested, and Joseph Ortiz's FNF dissolved, as well as General Lionel Chassin's MP13. De Gaulle also modified the government, excluding Jacques Soustelle, believed to be too pro-French Algeria, and granting the Minister of Information to Louis Terrenoire, who quit RTF (French broadcasting TV). Pierre Messmer, who had been a member of the Foreign Legion, was named Minister of Defense, and dissolved the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch, which had ordered the rebellion. These units had theorized the principles of a counter-revolutionary war, including the use of torture. During the Indochina War (1947\u201354), officers such as Roger Trinquier and Lionel-Max Chassin were inspired by Mao Zedong's strategic doctrine and acquired knowledge of convince the population to support the fight. The Fifth Bureau were organized by Jean Ousset, French representative of the Opus Dei, under the order of Permanent Secretary General of the National Defense (SGPDN) Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel.[64] The officers were initially trained in the Centre d'instruction et de pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 la contre-gu\u00e9rilla (Arzew). Jacques Chaban-Delmas added to that the Centre d'entra\u00eenement \u00e0 la guerre subversive Jeanne-d'Arc (Center of Training to Subversive War Jeanne-d'Arc) in Philippeville, Algeria, directed by Colonel Marcel Bigeard. According to the Voltaire Network, the Catholic stay-behind Georges Sauge animated conferences there, and the maxim \"This Army must be fanatic, despising luxury, animated by the spirit of the Crusades.\" appeared on the walls.[66] Pierre Messmer hence dissolved structures which had turned themselves against de Gaulle, leaving the \"revolutionary war\" to the exclusive responsibility of Gaullist General Andr\u00e9 Beaufre.[64]\n\nThe French army officers' uprising was due to a perceived second betrayal by the government, the first having been Indochina (1947\u20131954). In some aspects the Dien Bien Phu garrison was sacrificed with no metropolitan support, order was given to commanding officer General de Castries to \"let the affair die of its own, in serenity\" (\"laissez mourir l'affaire d'elle m\u00eame en s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9\"[67]).\n\nThe opposition of the UNEF student trade-union to the participation of conscripts in the war led to a secession in May 1960, with the creation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des \u00e9tudiants nationalistes (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students) around Dominique Venner, a former member of Jeune Nation and of MP-13, Fran\u00e7ois d'Orcival and Alain de Benoist, who would theorize in the 1980s the \"New Right\" movement. The FEN then published the Manifeste de la classe 60.\n\nA Front national pour l'Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise (FNAF, National Front for French Algeria) was created in June 1960 in Paris, gathering around de Gaulle's former Secretary Jacques Soustelle, Claude Dumont, Georges Sauge, Yvon Chautard, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour (who later competed in the 1965 presidential election), Jacques Isorni, Victor Barth\u00e9lemy, Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau and Jean-Marie Le Pen. Another ultra rebellion occurred in December 1960, which led de Gaulle to dissolve the FNAF.\n\nAfter the publication of the Manifeste des 121 against the use of torture and the war,[68] the opponents to the war created the Rassemblement de la gauche d\u00e9mocratique (Assembly of the Democratic Left), which included the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) socialist party, the Radical-Socialist Party, Force ouvri\u00e8re (FO) trade union, Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des Travailleurs Chr\u00e9tiens trade-union, UNEF trade-union, etc., which supported de Gaulle against the ultras.", "label": "historical", "id": 973}, {"paragraph": "Roman Forum\n\nThe Roman Forum, also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum (Italian: Foro Romano), is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.\n\nFor centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history.[1] Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.[2]\n\nMany of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman Kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome.\n\nOther archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area). This is where the Senate\u2014as well as Republican government itself\u2014began. The Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area.\n\nOver time the archaic Comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia (179 BC). Some 130 years later, Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia, along with the new Curia Julia, refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate itself. This new Forum, in what proved to be its final form, then served as a revitalized city square where the people of Rome could gather for commercial, political, judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers.\n\nEventually much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the Forum Romanum to the larger and more extravagant structures (Trajan's Forum and the Basilica Ulpia) to the north. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex\u2014the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD). This returned the political center to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.\n\nUnlike the later imperial fora in Rome\u2014which were self-consciously modelled on the ancient Greek plateia (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1) public plaza or town square\u2014the Roman Forum developed gradually, organically, and piecemeal over many centuries.[3] This is the case despite attempts, with some success, to impose some order there, by Sulla, Julius Caesar, Augustus and others. By the Imperial period, the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the open area to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 meters.[4]\n\nIts long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill. The Forum's basilicas during the Imperial period\u2014the Basilica Aemilia on the north and the Basilica Julia on the south\u2014defined its long sides and its final form. The Forum proper included this square, the buildings facing it and, sometimes, an additional area (the Forum Adjectum) extending southeast as far as the Arch of Titus.[5]\n\nOriginally, the site of the Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained.[6] This was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima.[7] Because of its location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries. Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early Republican times.[8]\n\nAs the ground around buildings rose, residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove. Its final travertine paving, still visible, dates from the reign of Augustus. Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another.

This increased hostility was directed toward the imperial regime of Czar Nicholas II and his unpopular German-born wife, Alexandra.\n\nRussia\u2019s simmering instability exploded in the Russian Revolution of 1917, spearheaded by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, which ended czarist rule and brought a halt to Russian participation in World War I.\n\nRussia reached an armistice with the Central Powers in early December 1917, freeing German troops to face the remaining Allies on the Western Front.\n", "label": "historical", "id": 976}, {"paragraph": "The war in the Pacific, 1938\u201341\nThe war in China, 1937\u201341\n\nin 1931\u201332 the Japanese had invaded Manchuria (Northeast China) and, after overcoming ineffective Chinese resistance there, had created the Japanese-controlled puppet state of Manchukuo. In the following years the Nationalist government of China, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, temporized in the face of Japanese military and diplomatic pressures and instead waged an internal war against the Chinese Communists, led by Mao Zedong, who were based in Shensi Province in north-central China. Meanwhile, the Japanese began a military buildup in North China proper, which in turn stimulated the formation of a unified resistance by the Nationalists and the Communists.\n\nOvert hostilities between Japan and China began after the Marco Polo Bridge incident of July 7, 1937, when shots were exchanged between Chinese and Japanese troops on the outskirts of Peking. Open fighting broke out in that area, and in late July the Japanese captured the Peking-Tientsin area. Thereupon full-scale hostilities began between the two nations. The Japanese landed near Shanghai, at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and took Shanghai in November and the Chinese capital, Nanking, in December 1937. Chiang Kai-shek moved his government to Han-k\u2019ou (one of the Wu-han cities), which lay 435 miles west of Shanghai along the Yangtze. The Japanese also pushed southward and westward from the Peking area into Hopeh and Shansi provinces. In 1938 the Japanese launched several ambitious military campaigns that brought them deep into the heart of central China. They advanced to the northeast and west from Nanking, taking Suchow and occupying the Wu-han cities. The Nationalists were forced to move their government to Chungking in Szechwan Province, about 500 miles west of the Wu-han cities. The Japanese also occupied Canton and several other coastal cities in South China in 1938.\n\nNationalist Chinese resistance to these Japanese advances was ineffective, primarily because the Nationalist leadership was still more interested in holding their forces in reserve for a future struggle with the Communists than in repelling the Japanese. By contrast, the Communists, from their base in north-central China, began an increasingly effective guerrilla war against the Japanese troops in Manchuria and North China. The Japanese needed large numbers of troops to maintain their hold on the immense Chinese territories and populations they controlled. Of the 51 infantry divisions making up the Japanese Army in 1941, 38 of them, comprising about 750,000 men, were stationed in China (including Manchuria).", "label": "historical", "id": 977}, {"paragraph": "Toward Armistice\nBy the fall of 1918, the Central Powers were unraveling on all fronts.\n\nDespite the Turkish victory at Gallipoli, later defeats by invading forces and an Arab revolt had combined to destroy the Ottoman economy and devastate its land, and the Turks signed a treaty with the Allies in late October 1918.\n\nAustria-Hungary, dissolving from within due to growing nationalist movements among its diverse population, reached an armistice on November 4.

On December 7, 1941, 360 Japanese aircraft attacked the major U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, taking the Americans completely by surprise and claiming the lives of more than 2,300 troops. The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. Germany and the other Axis Powers promptly declared war on the United States.\n\nAfter a long string of Japanese victories, the U.S. Pacific Fleet won the Battle of Midway in June 1942, which proved to be a turning point in the war. On Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomon Islands, the Allies also had success against Japanese forces in a series of battles from August 1942 to February 1943, helping turn the tide further in the Pacific. In mid-1943, Allied naval forces began an aggressive counterattack against Japan, involving a series of amphibious assaults on key Japanese-held islands in the Pacific. This \u201cisland-hopping\u201d strategy proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the Japanese homeland.\n\nToward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45)\n\nIn North Africa, British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943.

It is situated in the region bordering the Constantinois and Petite Kabylie (Basse Kabylie).\n\nIn 1982, Dj\u00e9mila became a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique adaptation of Roman architecture to a mountain environment. Significant buildings in ancient Cuicul include a theatre, two fora, temples, basilicas, arches, streets, and houses. The exceptionally well preserved ruins surround the forum of the Harsh, a large paved square with an entry marked by a majestic arch.\n\nRoman Cuicul\n\nUnder the name of Cuicul, the city was built 900 metres (3,000 ft) above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison situated on a narrow triangular plateau in the province of Numidia. The terrain is somewhat rugged, being located at the confluence of two rivers.\n\nCuicul's builders followed a standard plan with a forum at the center and two main streets, the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, composing the major axes.[1] The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market. The resources that contributed to the prosperity of the city were essentially agricultural (cereals, olive trees and farm).\n\nDuring the reign of Caracalla in the 3rd century, Cuicul's administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum. They surrounded it with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum. The terrain hindered building, so that they built the theatre outside the town walls, which was exceptional.\n\nChristianity became very popular in the 4th century (after some persecutions in the early third century[2]) and brought the addition of a basilica and baptistry. They are to the south of Cuicul in a quarter called \"Christian\", and are popular attractions.[1]\n\nOf the bishops of Cuicul, Pudentianus took part in the Council of Carthage (255) concerning the validity of heretical baptism, and Elpidophorus in the Council of Carthage (348). Cresconius was the Catholic bishop who represented Cuicul at the Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops; the Donatist bishop of the town died before the conference began. Crescens was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484. Victor was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553.[3][4][5][6] No longer a residential bishopric, Cuicul is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[7]\n\nThe city was slowly abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire around the 5th century and 6th century. There were some improvements under emperor Justinian I, with wall reinforcements.\n\nMuslims later dominated the region, but did not reoccupy the site of Cuicul, which they renamed Dj\u00e9mila (\"beautiful\" in Arabic).", "label": "historical", "id": 980}, {"paragraph": "Xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer\n\nDetails of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports.\n\nIt was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of Xbox's successor at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March. But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. The next Xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year, but very few details about it have been released. It is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, which takes place in May, according to a Reuters news agency report. E3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers, marketers and retailers. The GDC is aimed more at game developers. Microsoft chief, Bill Gates, used the GDC event to unveil the original Xbox five years ago. Since its launch, Microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide.\n\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. In his keynote speech, Mr Gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle.\n\nBut the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. Sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its PlayStation 2. But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002. Hit games like Halo 2, which was released in November, helped to buoy the sales figures.\n\nGamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power.\n\nThey are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. Although details of PlayStation 3, Xenon, and Nintendo's so-called Revolution, are yet to be finalised, developers are already working on titles. Rory Armes, studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe, recently told the BBC News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits.

High-profile web portals such as Google, Yahoo, Ebay and Amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. So many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. It urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways, meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. The site has so far received almost \u00a38 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour.\n\nTelco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on the DEC site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. It has also provided space in London's BT tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations.\n\nSome of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. On its famously sparse homepage Google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. Among the 17 organisations listed are Oxfam, Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Network for Good. Many of the sites that Google lists are also taking online donations. Online retailer Amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the American Red Cross that will be used with relief efforts. Auction site eBay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on eBay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. Yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. The Auction Drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras, computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. Sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. Anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies.

The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.\n\nBut the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. \"The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,\" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months. The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as \u00a334 but it could cost up to \u00a31,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year.

To make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.\n\nSensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research. \"The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,\" he said. The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. Microsoft, however, does provide an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem. \"The Remove Hidden Data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application,\" says the instructions on Microsoft's website. Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document. A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available. Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. Often, said Mr Pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.\n\nHowever, the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. The discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if, for instance, those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. The research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said Mr Pearson.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 984}, {"paragraph": "California sets fines for spyware\n\nThe makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California.\n\nFrom 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.\n\nOne form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs.

Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. \"I hope this day will focus people,\" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.\n\nThe group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other \"cyber-dissidents\". \"If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',\" said Mr Hopkins. \"That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. \"If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.\" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.\n\nThe Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. \"Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. \"But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.\"\n\nIt is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.\n\n\"This is a big messy argument,\" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: \"It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs.\" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, \"is part of the whole messy conversation.\" \"If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. \"Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,\" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. \"That is the essential difference.

Ebay also announced the Rethink project bringing together Intel, Apple, and IBM among others to promote recycling. The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices, one of the fastest growing markets in technology. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly \u00a368 billion).\n\nEbay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. The online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. \"We really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good,\" eBay's David Stern told the BBC News website.\n\n\"We saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment.\" But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. Teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months, adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. Yet, only 15% are actually recycled. This year, a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile, according to a Deloitte report. Schemes in the US, like RIPMobile, could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. The initiative, which was also launched at CES, rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. \"This system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games,\" said Seth Heine from RIPMobile.\n\nOne group of students collected 1,000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes \"learned behaviour\". Europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the US in terms of recycling awareness and robust \"end of life\" programmes, although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. Intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at CES which are entirely lead free.\n\n\"There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,\" Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website. \"There is still low-level awareness right now, but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in Europe.\" A European Union (EU) directive, WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment), comes into effect in August. It puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. Elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the EU by 2006.\n\nBut it is not just about recycling either. The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. The biggest culprit, according to the EPA, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed \"energy vampires\". They provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players.\n\nAlthough there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. On 1 January, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the European Commission Code of Conduct. But at CES, the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters. These map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo, meaning they are about 35% more efficient. The initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. Most are made in China. About two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the US alone. The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. \"We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,\" the EPA's Andrew Fanara said. Initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the EPA.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 987}, {"paragraph": "Kenyan school turns to handhelds\n\nAt the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.\n\nThey are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. \"The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals.\" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. \"It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.\"\n\nThe system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. \"It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.\"\n\nThe project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. \"The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.\" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. \"All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard\" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. \"We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.\" Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. \"Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks?

The number of holes considered \"critical\" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.\n\nOne of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as \"critical\". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 989}, {"paragraph": "Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC\n\nNicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (\u00a353).\n\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\n\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 990}, {"paragraph": "Latest Opera browser gets vocal\n\nNet browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\n\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\n\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\n\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 991}, {"paragraph": "Spam e-mails tempt net shoppers\n\nComputer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests.\n\nMore than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. As well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic, organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) warned that people should \"stay alert\". \"Many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,\" said Mike Newton, a spokesperson for the BSA which commissioned the survey.\n\n\"By selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. \"Once the software is installed on PCs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused.\"\n\nThe results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam. A third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.\n\nThe French were the second most likely to buy something (48%), with 44% of Britons taking advantage of products and services. This was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. More than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information. \"Both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail, helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites,\" said William Plante, director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm Symantec. \"At the same time, consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters, spyware detection software and sound judgement.\"\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 992}, {"paragraph": "Be careful how you code\n\nA new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson.\n\nIf it gets its way, the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. If the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our TV screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. Sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess Middle Britain. After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention? Yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the EU's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in Europe just as they are in the US. Many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.\n\nIn the US you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless Amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on \"one-click\" online purchase. It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.\n\nWe are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. They have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in their original form. Some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. Poland has rejected the proposal and Germany's main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.\n\nThe draft Directive is being put through the council as what is called an \"A\" item and can only be approved or rejected. No discussion or amendment is allowed. So why should we be worried? First, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. This goes to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. If coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow?\n\nMore directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. This is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. Patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. I have never, to my shame, managed to read Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence. The same does not hold for a patent. If I sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the LZW algorithm used in GIF files, then I am in trouble under patent law, at least in the US. Coincidence is no defence. The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.\n\nEven this system breaks down, of course, as Microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent. That one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. The damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. And it will damage Europe's computer industry. We can only hope that the Council of Ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.\n\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 993}, {"paragraph": "What's in the latest Chrome update?

The program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.\n\nBefore now many spammers have recruited home PCs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. The PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. Once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. Spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. Steve Linford, director of Spamhaus, predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's e-mail sending infrastructure. David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust, said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. \"They are adding to their armoury,\" he said. The amount of spam in circulation was still growing, said Mr Stanley, but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. But Kevin Hogan, senior manager at Symantec security response, said such warnings were premature. \"If something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago,\" said Mr Hogan. While the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. Mr Hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. For instance, said Mr Hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 996}, {"paragraph": "Ask Jeeves joins web log market\n\nAsk Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.\n\nThe Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.\n\nBloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\n\n\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone.

Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from \u00a319 to \u00a329. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\n\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.\n\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \"download play\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\n\nThe launch price of \u00a399 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \"It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\" he says. \"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\"\n\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\n\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\". \"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\" Mr Iwata added.

Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\n\nThe growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\n\n\"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"It's about outright criminality now,\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"If you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said Mr King, \"they just do what works.\"\n\nAs the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\n\nMany will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"The main motivation now is money,\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\n", "label": "technologie", "id": 1000}]
